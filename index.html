<section id="info">
    <p>
        The Tempest's Box adds countless features to the vanilla Minecraft - without needing to install mods! - providing you with many new items, blocks, entities, structures, and more!

    <br><br>

        This project is an update of <a href="/faq#Who-is-Zoey?">Zoey's</a> TTB for 1.16+. Similarly to the classic TTB,  we want as much involvement from the community as possible with the project!
