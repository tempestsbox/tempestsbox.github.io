TTB comes with two new ores - Vulcaanium and Amethyst.
## Amethyst
Amethyst is used to craft certain machines, but most importantly, it can be placed into Tempite Stone to power nearby machines.  
It can be found at Y<=40.
## Vulcaanium
Vulcaanium is used to craft some items such as the Eckspei Rod; however, it's mostly used to ascend machines into something more powerful.  
It can be found at Y<=32.

## Ore Dweller
The Ore Dweller is the unfortunate result of an experiment which occurred during the Reckoning. It is looking for something, unsure about the purpose of its existence. You can find them roaming in the caves. On death, it drops various metals and ores, but only when mined.
