description: "The Tempite Stone is needed to power all the machines in TTB. Without it, your machines can't work!"
extra_description: "Use a Hopper feed it Amethyst. 1 Amethyst → 1000 Tempite. When activated, any adjacent Stained Glass blocks will be powered with Tempite, sending out a wire-like charge. If this charge hits a machine, the machine will be powered, costing Tempite from the nearest Tempite Stone within 16 blocks."
